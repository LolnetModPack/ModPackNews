  <h3>Minecraft Pocket Edition - (Last updated on October 26, 2014, by Arns)</h3>
  <p>EDIT: Has been closed due to griefing! Sorting out Perms, will keep you up-dated!              Hello Guys, I have currently got an MCPE server up and running, It's not an official lolnet ip yet though (Wait a month and we should have an official mcpe.lolnet.co.nz ip) So the current ip is 122.59.171.196:19132! I will have a tutorial up <a href="http://goo.gl/QoKPBt">here</a> in about an hour of this update. It is currently a work in progress server so expect crashes and restarts.  </p>

  <h3>LolnetLauncher 0.9.9 update - (Posted on October 14, 2014, by James137137)</h3>
  <p>LolnetLauncher is almost at Version 1.0. Doing some final improvements. LolnetLauncher now has a exe version for Windows (see <a href="https://james137137.ci.cloudbees.com/job/LolnetLauncher/">link</a>) you can still use the .jar version if you like, I personally like the exe cause I can put it on my task bar. The autoUpdater should work without any problems, if you do have any suggestions or find any problems/bugs please make a post on the forum. </p>
